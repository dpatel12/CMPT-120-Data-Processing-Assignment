# CMPT 120: Data Processing Assignment
## Introduction
The **Data Processing Assignment** was the final assignment of **CMPT 120** in the **Fall 2019** semester at **SFU**. Approximately 2 weeks were given to complete the assignment. The option to complete the assignment as a team existed, but I decided to complete the assignment on my own. Provided code was given by Professor Diana Cukierman to read and write to .csv files, but all other code is my own.

In addition to the programming assignment, we were tasked with creating a flowchart to better visualize and explain the top (global) level of the file.
